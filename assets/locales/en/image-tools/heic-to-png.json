        {
          "question": "Q1. What is a HEIC image?",
          "answer": "A. HEIC is a high-compression, high-quality image format used in Apple products. Since Windows and some services don't support it, converting to PNG makes it easier to handle."
        },
        {
          "question": "Q2. Is transparency maintained?",
          "answer": "A. If the original image contains transparency information, it will be automatically reflected. However, if there is no transparency in the image (like in photos), it will be PNG-converted as is."
        },
        {
          "question": "Q3. Will the file size increase?",
          "answer": "A. Since PNG is an uncompressed format, file sizes may be larger than HEIC, but image quality is preserved."
        },
        {
          "question": "Q4. Can I convert multiple images simultaneously?",
          "answer": "A. Currently, we support converting one image at a time, but we plan to add batch processing in the future."
        },
        {
          "question": "Q5. Are uploaded images saved?",
          "answer": "A. No, uploaded images are deleted from the server immediately after conversion. We consider security and privacy important."
